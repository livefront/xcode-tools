# Xcode Tools

This is a repository of helpful tools to make Xcode development at Livefront more enjoyable.

This includes:
* [Code Snippets](#code-snippets)
* [New File Templates](#new-file-templates)
* [Source Editor Extensions](#source-editor-templates)

## Code Snippets

Code snippets add custom auto-complete options to the Xcode source code editor. These can be used as
shortcuts for commonly typed code such as functions, statements, or comments.

## New File Templates

Xcode file templates add new options to the `New > Fileâ€¦` dialog. They can create a single new file
or a several related files. When a custom template option is selected, the user will be asked to
supply a file name or multiple values depending on the structure of the template. The resulting 
files and their content will be dynamically generated based on the user input.

## Source Editor Extensions

Source editor extensions add custom commands to the editor menu in Xcode. They can modify the source
code of the current file or operate on the currently selected text.
