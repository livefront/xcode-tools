# Xcode Tools

At Livefront, weâ€™re always looking for ways to make our tools and workflows more powerful and 
efficient. We created the Xcode Tools project to supercharge iOS app development. The project 
contains a variety of tools that extend Xcode to make common tasks faster, avoid mistakes, and 
produce consistent high-quality code. From comment formatting to new file templates, each tool is 
designed to cut out the busy work and allow developers to focus on delivering great software.

## How does it work?

In this repository, you will find a variety of pre-made tools which you can add to your Xcode 
installation. The source editor extension adds new Xcode menu items which you can use to modify your 
source code and ensure consistent, clean results. New file templates augment the New File menu with 
a variety of options to quickly generate common source file types. Code snippets add in-line source 
editor completions to quickly insert commonly-typed source code without breaking your flow.

## How do I use it?

The repository is organized into sections for each of the primary tool types. Within each section, 
you will find detailed installation instructions to guide you through adding the tools to your Xcode 
instance.
