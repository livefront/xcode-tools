# Code Snippets

Code snippets add custom auto-complete options to the Xcode source code editor. These can be used as
shortcuts for commonly typed code such as functions, statements, or comments.

## How to Install
Copy `.codesnippet` files to `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/CodeSnippets/` and restart Xcode to install.
