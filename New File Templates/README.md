# New File Templates

Xcode file templates add new options to the `New > Fileâ€¦` dialog. They can create a single new file
or a several related files. When a custom template option is selected, the user will be asked to
supply a file name or multiple values depending on the structure of the template. The resulting 
files and their content will be dynamically generated based on the user input.
